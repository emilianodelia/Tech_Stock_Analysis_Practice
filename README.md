# Tech_Stock_Analysis

This is an individual assignmet I did for my Python class of my Master's in Big Data & Business Analytics

This exercise was a great way to consolidate everything I learned about Python from October 2021 to March 2022

Core elements of the notebook:
* Analyzed the following tech stocks: MSFT, GOOG, AMZN & AAPL
* Performed data cleaning processes related to handling missing values
* Visualized price change across different timeframes 
* Coded functions to calculate the ROI for each stock in different timeframes
* Visualized ROI for each stock for different timeframes
* Applied the function to different portfolios with different distributions of each tech stock to find the best perfoeming portfolio
* Manually looked for a better performing portfolio in terms of ROI with the help of a UDF
